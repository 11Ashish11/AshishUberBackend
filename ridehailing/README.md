## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | What's Done | What's Pending |
|-------------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Real-time driver location ingestion** | ✅ Done | `POST /v1/drivers/{id}/location` updates Redis GEO index + Postgres; 30s TTL auto-expires stale drivers; WebSocket broadcasts location to frontend map; every GPS ping published to `driver-locations` Kafka topic | No server-side rate enforcement of 1–2 updates/sec cadence; no driver-side push — purely request-driven |
| **Ride request flow** | ✅ Done | `POST /v1/rides` accepts pickup/destination coords, vehicleTier, paymentMethod, riderId; idempotency keys prevent duplicates; active ride check prevents double-booking; ride event published to `ride-requests` Kafka topic | — |
| **Dispatch/Matching** | ✅ Done | Redis GEOSEARCH finds nearest driver (microsecond queries); distributed lock (SET NX) prevents double-assignment; reassign on driver decline — marks DECLINED, unlocks driver, tries next; full `REQUESTED → MATCHING → MATCHED → ACCEPTED` state machine | No timeout-based reassignment — if driver goes silent, no scheduler fires to retry; no p95 SLA measurement |
| **Dynamic surge pricing** | Partial | Demand tracked per geohash cell (1km grid) in Redis with 5min TTL; surge tiers: 1.0×/1.2×/1.5×/2.0× based on demand count; cached per area with 60s TTL; applied at ride creation and fare calculation | Supply side not factored in — only raw demand count, not demand/supply ratio; no driver-count-per-cell signal |
| **Trip lifecycle** | ✅ Done | Trip auto-created on driver accept; `POST /v1/trips/{id}/end` with Haversine distance + tiered fare calculation; surge multiplier applied to final fare; driver re-added to Redis availability pool on completion; rider notified via WebSocket; `TRIP_COMPLETED` + `TRIP_STARTED` Kafka events published | No PAUSE/RESUME state; no receipt generation (email/PDF) |
| **Kafka event streaming** | ✅ Done | KRaft-mode Kafka (no ZooKeeper); 3 topics: `ride-events`, `driver-locations`, `ride-requests`; producers publish on every state change; consumers log all events; `ErrorHandlingDeserializer` wraps JsonDeserializer for fault tolerance; type headers ensure correct deserialization per topic | — |
| **Payments orchestration** | Partial | PSP stub simulating Razorpay/Stripe (90% success, 200–1500ms latency); idempotency keys prevent duplicate charges; full status lifecycle: `PENDING → PROCESSING → SUCCESS/FAILED`; rider notified via WebSocket on outcome | Stub only — no real PSP SDK integration; no automatic retry on FAILED; no reconciliation job |
| **Notifications** | Partial | WebSocket/STOMP push for: ride offer to driver, driver matched to rider, trip fare on completion, payment result | No SMS (no Twilio); no mobile push (no FCM/APNS); WebSocket only — requires active browser connection |
| **Admin/ops tooling** | ❌ Not Done | — | No feature flags; no kill-switches; no circuit breakers; no admin endpoints; no APM integration |

  (durable state)   (geo, locks)   (event stream)
```

**Kafka Topics:**
```
ride-events      ← all ride state transitions (key=rideId)
driver-locations ← high-frequency GPS pings  (key=driverId)
ride-requests    ← rider booking commands     (key=requestId)
```

**Why Modular Monolith?** Clean separation of concerns with the operational simplicity of a single deployment. Each module has its own controller, service, repository, and model layers. In production, these can be independently deployed as microservices.

## Core Features

- **Real-time Driver Matching** — Redis GEOSEARCH finds nearest available drivers within 5km in microseconds
- **Distributed Locking** — Redis SET NX prevents double-assignment of drivers
- **Dynamic Surge Pricing** — Demand-based multiplier per geo-cell (1km grid)
- **Trip Lifecycle** — Clean state machine: REQUESTED → MATCHING → MATCHED → ACCEPTED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED
- **Ride Cancellation** — Cancel rides before trip starts (REQUESTED, MATCHING, MATCHED statuses only)
- **Payment via PSP Stub** — Simulates Razorpay/Stripe with 90% success rate, random latency, and idempotency
- **Idempotent APIs** — Both ride creation and payments support idempotency keys to prevent duplicates
- **WebSocket Live Updates** — STOMP over WebSocket pushes ride status and driver locations to frontend
- **Haversine Distance** — Accurate fare calculation using great-circle distance formula
- **Kafka Event Streaming** — Every ride state transition and driver GPS update is published to Kafka for downstream consumers (analytics, billing, notifications)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 17
- Docker Desktop
- Node.js (for frontend)

### 1. Start Infrastructure

```bash
# From project root (where docker-compose.yml is)
docker compose up -d
```

This starts:
- PostgreSQL on port **5433**
- Redis on port **6379**
- Kafka (KRaft) on port **9092**

### 2. Start Backend

```bash
cd ridehailing
./gradlew bootRun
```

The app starts on `http://localhost:8080`. On first run, it seeds the database with 2 test riders and 5 test drivers around Bangalore. Kafka topics are auto-created on first message.

### 3. Test the Full Ride Flow

```bash
# Get rider and driver IDs
docker exec -it ridehailing-db psql -U admin -d ridehailing \
  -c "SELECT id, name FROM riders;"
docker exec -it ridehailing-db psql -U admin -d ridehailing \
  -c "SELECT id, name, status, vehicle_type FROM drivers;"

# Put a driver online
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/drivers/{DRIVER_ID}/online

# Send driver location
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/drivers/{DRIVER_ID}/location \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"latitude": 12.9352, "longitude": 77.6245}'

# Create a ride
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/rides \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "riderId": "{RIDER_ID}",
    "pickupLat": 12.9340,
    "pickupLng": 77.6200,
    "destinationLat": 12.9716,
    "destinationLng": 77.5946,
    "vehicleTier": "SEDAN",
    "paymentMethod": "UPI",
    "idempotencyKey": "ride-001"
  }'

# Cancel a ride (before trip starts)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/rides/{RIDE_ID}/cancel

# Driver accepts
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/v1/drivers/{DRIVER_ID}/accept?rideId={RIDE_ID}"

# End trip
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/trips/{TRIP_ID}/end \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"endLat": 12.9716, "endLng": 77.5946}'

# Process payment
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tripId": "{TRIP_ID}",
    "paymentMethod": "UPI",
    "idempotencyKey": "pay-001"
  }'
```

## Kafka Event Flow

Every key action in the ride lifecycle automatically publishes a message to Kafka:

| Trigger | Topic | Event Type | Key |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rider creates a ride | `ride-events` | `REQUESTED` | `rideId` |
| Driver accepts | `ride-events` | `DRIVER_ASSIGNED` | `rideId` |
| Trip created | `ride-events` | `TRIP_STARTED` | `rideId` |
| Ride cancelled | `ride-events` | `CANCELLED` | `rideId` |
| Driver sends GPS | `driver-locations` | GPS payload | `driverId` |

**Consumer groups:**
- `ride-state-tracker` — consumes `ride-events`, logs all state transitions
- `driver-location-tracker` — consumes `driver-locations`, logs GPS updates

All ride events are **keyed by `rideId`** so events for the same ride always land in the same partition, guaranteeing ordered processing.

## Database Schema

6 tables: `riders`, `drivers`, `rides`, `ride_assignments`, `trips`, `payments`

Key design decisions:
- **rides vs trips separation** — A ride is the request; a trip is the actual journey. Not every ride becomes a trip.
- **ride_assignments table** — Tracks the full chain of driver offers (offered → declined → offered → accepted). Enables debugging and fairness analysis.
- **Idempotency keys** — On both rides and payments to prevent duplicates from network retries.

## Redis Usage

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `driver:locations` (GEO) | Spatial index for GEOSEARCH — find nearest drivers in microseconds |
| `driver:available:{id}` (TTL 30s) | Driver availability — auto-expires if driver stops sending updates |
| `driver:lock:{id}` (SET NX, TTL 20s) | Distributed lock — prevents double-assignment |
| `surge:{geohash}` (TTL 60s) | Cached surge multiplier per area |
| `demand:{geohash}` (TTL 5min) | Request counter for surge calculation |

## Concurrency Handling

| Race Condition | Solution |
|---------------|----------|
| Two rides offered to same driver | Redis SET NX distributed lock |
| Rider creates duplicate rides | Idempotency key + active ride check |
| Double payment for same trip | Idempotency key + DB unique constraint |
| Driver accepts expired offer | Assignment status must be OFFERED |
| Stale driver in pool | TTL auto-expiry on availability keys |

## Ride Cancellation Logic

Riders can cancel rides before the trip officially starts. The cancellation flow:

**Cancellable Statuses:**
- `REQUESTED` - Ride just created, matching in progress
- `MATCHING` - System is searching for drivers
- `MATCHED` - Driver found and offered the ride

**Non-Cancellable Statuses:**
- `ACCEPTED` - Driver accepted, trip about to start/started (returns 400 error)
- `IN_PROGRESS` - Trip already started (returns 400 error)
- `COMPLETED` - Trip finished (returns 400 error)
- `CANCELLED` - Already cancelled (returns 400 error)

**Cancellation Actions:**
1. Validates ride exists and is in cancellable status
2. If a driver was matched/assigned, releases the distributed lock on that driver
3. Updates ride status to `CANCELLED`
4. Returns updated ride response

**Handling "Active Ride" Errors:**
If you get a `409 Conflict` error saying "Rider already has an active ride", it means there's a stale ride from a previous session. Solutions:

1. **Via API** - Find the active ride ID and cancel it:
   ```bash
   # Get rider's rides from database
   docker exec -it ridehailing-db psql -U admin -d ridehailing \
     -c "SELECT id, status FROM rides WHERE rider_id = '{RIDER_ID}' ORDER BY created_at DESC;"

   # Cancel the active ride
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/rides/{RIDE_ID}/cancel
   ```

2. **Via Database** - Directly update stale rides:
   ```sql
   UPDATE rides
   SET status = 'CANCELLED'
   WHERE rider_id = '{RIDER_ID}'
   AND status IN ('REQUESTED', 'MATCHING', 'MATCHED', 'ACCEPTED');
   ```
